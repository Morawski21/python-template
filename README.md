# Python Project Template

A modern Python project template with uv, ruff, pytest and a simple pre-commit config.
I made it mostly for my personal projects, but feel free to use it yourself.

## Setup

Make sure you have Python 3.13+, uv, just, and Git installed.
Install dependencies:
```bash
just setup
```

## Tools

- **uv** - Package management
- **just** - Command runner
- **pre-commit** - Git hooks
- **ruff** - Code quality
